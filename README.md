# Developing Web-Based Machine Learning Models for Customer Churn Prediction

Customer churn is one of the biggest challenges in the telecom industry. This project aims to predict whether a customer is likely to leave the service using machine learning techniques, and deploy the model in a web-based application using Flask.

## üìå Introduction

This project combines the power of machine learning and web development to create an end-to-end solution for predicting customer churn. It allows business users to input customer data through a browser and instantly receive a churn prediction.

The model has been trained using customer demographics, services opted for, account information, and billing behavior from a telecom dataset. The entire system is lightweight, efficient, and user-friendly.

## ‚úÖ Uses

- **Telecom Companies**: To proactively identify at-risk customers and take retention actions.
- **Customer Success Teams**: To prioritize outreach based on churn probability.
- **Business Analysts**: For understanding key drivers of churn.
- **Academia**: As a reference for deploying machine learning models on the web.

## üìä Model Features

The model uses the following features for churn prediction:

- Customer demographics (gender, senior citizen, etc.)
- Service details (internet, phone, streaming)
- Account information (tenure, contract type)
- Billing behavior (payment method, monthly charges)
